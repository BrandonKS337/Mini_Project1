# Mini_Project1
First of 3 Mini-Projects prior to Capstone. My Plan is to orient each of the projects towards my capstone project to help lesson the development work load required to complete a fullstack application by the designated deadline.

Description:
The purpose of the Mini Project is to reinforce skills that have been covered in recent modules.
Select a data set and analyze it using the techniques learned in recent modules. Prepare and present a 10-minute presentation in class.

Create fictitious company name, goal, product they're trying sell (get them to sign up, or contact you through the CTA)

Create a landing page from a UI design (do not need to create your own in Figma, search for one to base yours off)
- Navbar with login and sign up buttons
- Hero image (on left or right, or your choice)
- Title letters, small description, with CTA (call to action) button

Create a login/sign up page.
 - Input fields for name, (maybe username), email, password, and any other info needed
 - Link and bottom of form for "Already have account - Log in" or "Forgot password?"
 - After sign up or login, navigate to dashboard or home page

Optional:
Create the dashboard or home page, very simple does not need to have all the elements for a fully working app.
Code in React, use MUI or other framework
